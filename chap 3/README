# **COMMUNICATING_WITH_PIPE.PY**
This code demonstrates interprocess communication using Pipe from the multiprocessing module. It shows how data can be sent and received between two processes through a pipe, allowing for efficient and direct data sharing.

---

# **COMMUNICATING_WITH_QUEUE.PY**
This code showcases interprocess communication using Queue from the multiprocessing module. A shared queue is used to exchange data between multiple producer and consumer processes in a thread-safe manner.

---

# **DEROM.PY**
This code focuses on a specialized functionality related to multiprocessing or threading. It likely involves specific use cases, such as demonstrating task delegation or resource management, depending on its context.

---

# **KILLING_PROCESSES.PY**
This code demonstrates how to manage and terminate processes in Python. It shows how processes can be started, checked for status, and terminated programmatically using the multiprocessing module.

---

# **MYFUNC.PY**
This code defines and demonstrates the execution of a simple function using multiprocessing or threading. It showcases how multiple threads or processes can independently execute the defined function.

---

# **NAMING_PROCESSES.PY**
This code demonstrates how to assign custom names to processes using the multiprocessing module. It shows the benefits of naming processes for better debugging and monitoring.

---

# **PROCESS_IN_SUBCLASS.PY**
This code demonstrates how to define a custom process class by subclassing Process from the multiprocessing module. It includes overriding the run method to specify custom behavior for the process.

---

# **PROCESS_POOL.PY**
This code demonstrates the use of Pool from the multiprocessing module to manage a pool of worker processes. It shows how tasks can be distributed among multiple workers for parallel execution, making it ideal for tasks like map-reduce operations.

---

# **PROCESSES_BARRIER.PY**
This code uses the Barrier synchronization primitive to demonstrate how multiple processes can synchronize at a specific point in their execution before continuing further.

---

# **RUN_BACKGROUND_PROCESSES.PY**
This code demonstrates how to run processes in the background. It shows how processes can be started and detached from the main execution flow to perform tasks independently.

---

# **RUN_BACKGROUND_PROCESSES_NO_DAEMONS.PY**
This code demonstrates how to run non-daemon background processes. Unlike daemon processes, these processes are not terminated abruptly when the main program exits, ensuring graceful execution.

---

# **SPAWNING_PROCESSES.PY**
This code demonstrates how to spawn new processes using the multiprocessing module. It highlights the basic functionality of creating, starting, and managing child processes.

---

# **SPAWNING_PROCESSES_NAMESPACE.PY**
This code extends process spawning to include shared namespaces. It demonstrates how multiple processes can share data using a common namespace, facilitating interprocess collaboration.
