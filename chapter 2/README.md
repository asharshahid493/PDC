**BARRIER.PY:** THIS CODE SIMULATES A RACE BETWEEN THREE RUNNERS USING THREADS AND A BARRIER TO SYNCHRONIZE THEIR ARRIVAL AT THE FINISH LINE.

**CONDITION.PY:** THIS CODE IMPLEMENTS A PRODUCER-CONSUMER PROBLEM USING THREADING AND A CONDITION VARIABLE TO SYNCHRONIZE THE PRODUCER AND CONSUMER THREADS. THE PRODUCER ADDS ITEMS TO A SHARED LIST, AND THE CONSUMER REMOVES ITEMS, WAITING IF THERE ARE NO ITEMS TO CONSUME AND NOTIFYING WHEN AN ITEM IS PRODUCED OR CONSUMED.

**EVENT.PY:** THIS CODE IMPLEMENTS A SIMPLE PRODUCER-CONSUMER PROBLEM USING THREADING AND AN EVENT TO SYNCHRONIZE THE PRODUCER AND CONSUMER THREADS. THE PRODUCER THREAD APPENDS RANDOM ITEMS TO A SHARED LIST AND NOTIFIES THE CONSUMER THREAD, WHICH POPS ITEMS FROM THE LIST. THE EVENT IS USED TO CONTROL THE FLOW BETWEEN PRODUCER AND CONSUMER, MAKING SURE THE CONSUMER ONLY CONSUMES WHEN ITEMS ARE AVAILABLE.

**MYTHREADCLASS.PY:** THIS CODE CREATES AND RUNS 9 THREADS USING THE Thread CLASS FROM THE threading MODULE. EACH THREAD HAS A RANDOM DURATION (BETWEEN 1 AND 10 SECONDS) FOR WHICH IT SLEEPS, SIMULATING A TASK. THE THREADS PRINT MESSAGES WHEN THEY BEGIN AND END, INCLUDING THE PROCESS ID. THE join() METHOD IS USED TO ENSURE THAT THE MAIN THREAD WAITS FOR ALL THREADS TO FINISH BEFORE PRINTING "End" AND DISPLAYING THE EXECUTION TIME.

**MYTHREADCLASS_LOCK.PY:** THIS CODE CREATES AND RUNS 9 THREADS WITH A LOCK MECHANISM TO ENSURE THAT ONLY ONE THREAD CAN EXECUTE ITS CRITICAL SECTION (THE PART WHERE IT PRINTS MESSAGES AND SLEEPS) AT A TIME. THE threadLock.acquire() CALL ENSURES THAT ONLY ONE THREAD ENTERS THE CRITICAL SECTION AT ONCE, AND THE threadLock.release() CALL RELEASES THE LOCK AFTER THE THREAD HAS COMPLETED ITS TASK. THE THREADS PRINT MESSAGES WHEN THEY BEGIN AND END, INCLUDING THE PROCESS ID, AND THE MAIN THREAD WAITS FOR ALL THREADS TO FINISH BEFORE DISPLAYING "End" AND THE EXECUTION TIME.

**MYTHREADCLASS_LOCK2.PY:** THREADS SIMULATE RANDOM DURATIONS WHILE ENSURING MUTUAL EXCLUSION USING A LOCK FOR PRINTING MESSAGES.

**RLOCK.PY:** THIS CODE DEMONSTRATES THE USE OF THREADS AND REENTRANT LOCKS TO ADD AND REMOVE ITEMS FROM A SHARED BOX CONCURRENTLY.

**SEMAPHORE.PY:** THIS CODE DEMONSTRATES THE USE OF SEMAPHORES TO SYNCHRONIZE THE PRODUCER AND CONSUMER THREADS, WHERE THE PRODUCER GENERATES AN ITEM AND THE CONSUMER CONSUMES IT.

**THREADDEFINITON.PY:** THIS CODE CREATES AND STARTS 10 THREADS, EACH CALLING THE my_func FUNCTION WITH A UNIQUE THREAD NUMBER.

**THREAD_DETERMINE.PY:** THIS CODE CREATES THREE THREADS, EACH EXECUTING A DIFFERENT FUNCTION (function_A, function_B, function_C) AND PRINTING MESSAGES BEFORE AND AFTER SLEEPING FOR 2 SECONDS.

**THREAD_NAME_AND_PROCESSES.PY:** THIS CODE CREATES TWO THREADS (Thread#1 AND Thread#2), EACH PRINTING THE THREAD NAME AND PROCESS ID, AND THEN JOINS THEM TO WAIT FOR THEIR COMPLETION BEFORE PRINTING "END".

**THREADING_WITH_QUEUE.PY:** THIS CODE DEMONSTRATES THREAD SYNCHRONIZATION USING A QUEUE, WHERE A PRODUCER THREAD APPENDS RANDOM ITEMS TO THE QUEUE AND MULTIPLE CONSUMER THREADS POP ITEMS FROM THE QUEUE TO PROCESS THEM
