CONCURRENT_FUTURES_POOLING.PY
This code demonstrates the use of the concurrent.futures module to perform task pooling, allowing for concurrent execution of tasks using thread or process pools. It is useful for parallelizing independent tasks.

COROUTINE.PY
This code demonstrates the use of coroutines in Python using the asyncio module. Coroutines allow for asynchronous execution and are particularly useful for I/O-bound and high-level structured network code.

DEALING.PY
This code provides an example of managing multiple tasks in an asynchronous environment. It demonstrates how to handle exceptions, cancellations, and other task-related operations effectively.

EVENT_LOOPS.PY
This code demonstrates the concept of an event loop in Python, where asynchronous tasks are executed. It shows how asyncio event loops can be used to manage and run multiple coroutines.

MANIPULATING_TASK.PY
This code demonstrates how to manipulate asynchronous tasks in Python. It includes creating, cancelling, and awaiting tasks using the asyncio module, showcasing control over their lifecycle.
