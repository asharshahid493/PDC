**ALLTOALL.PY**
This code demonstrates the Alltoall communication pattern in MPI, where each process sends data to all other processes and receives data from all of them. It is useful for data redistribution scenarios in parallel computing.

**BROADCAST.PY**
This code demonstrates the Broadcast communication operation in MPI, where a single process sends the same data to all other processes in the communicator. It is typically used for distributing shared data.

**DEADLOCKPROBLEMS.PY**
This code illustrates potential deadlock scenarios in parallel programming and provides strategies to avoid or resolve deadlocks during interprocess communication.

**POINT_TO_POINT_COMM.PY**
This code demonstrates point-to-point communication in MPI, where data is exchanged directly between two processes using send and receive operations.

**REDUCTION.PY**
This code demonstrates the Reduction operation in MPI, where data from multiple processes is combined using a specific operation (e.g., sum, max, min) to produce a single result. It is often used for aggregating data in parallel programs.

**SCATTER.PY**
This code demonstrates the Scatter communication pattern in MPI, where data from one process is divided into chunks and distributed to all processes in the communicator.

**VIRTUALTOPOLOGY.PY**
This code demonstrates the creation of virtual topologies in MPI, where processes are arranged logically (e.g., in grids or rings) to optimize communication and computation in parallel programs.
